Hi! My name is Ryan Cushen, and I'm a recent economics graduate from The University of Melbourne. This blog is a pet project intended to discuss anything and everything related to economics and statistics. You can expect posts concerning:

* Expositions of applied statistical or econometric techniques
* Analysis of interesting datasets
* Explorations of current-affairs economics issues

Most of the computational heavy-lifting in each post is using either Python or R. I do my best to include relevant code snippets, though more complete script files for each post will be available on my Github. All questions and comments are very welcome!
